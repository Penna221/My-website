          <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a finnish <b>programmer</b> with a passion for
            <b>content creation</b> and <b>games</b>. I believe in the power of
            persistence and truth. I <b>graduated</b> from Savonia University of
            Applied Sciences in 2023 as a <b> Bachelor of Engineering </b>with
            <b>Degree Programme in Information Technology </b>

          <h2>What I Do:</h2>
          <p>
            In this space, I try to <b>gather together everything i do</b>.
            Through my work, I aim to get better at coding and some day i might
            create something valuable.

          <h2>Why I Do It:</h2>
          <p>
            My journey began when i was in elementary school and one of my
            teachers started teaching about computers. I really enjoyed it and
            started to learn coding. Since then, I've been
            <b>developing my skills</b>
            and gotten a bit better. <b>I'm fueled</b> by the constant
            <b>puzzles</b> i have to solve. Some puzzles are easy to solve, and
            others not so much. But the <b>satisfaction</b> after solving a hard
            one, is like the best.
